"always, always and always horrible performance specially in the holidays seasons :(  Two accidents with two orders in only one week, and these are not my only bad experience, it's been a lot. If your order is from a store that uses only Fedex for shipping, your order is in a big risk, so try to always give much more time for their horrible performance damages! I wish there was below zero rating we could've given."
"Been waiting on a package that was delivered 7 days ago. I check FEDEX website to see that the package has been sitting in my state for the last 5 days. I could of drove to the place my package was and got it over and done with within a few hours, so what is the excuse for my package to be in my state, but not delivered to me? It is food! Not merch!! NO excuse for this! Cant handle the work load? HIRE MORE DRIVERS!!!"
Terrible customer service. My parcel was delayed for over two weeks simply because Fedex was incompetent in handling my parcel. I had to call everyday to follow and it turned out that my parcel was misplaced. I wouldn’t recommend using Fedex at all. I think they need to close down the business and go home. They would be more efficient.
"FedEx worst delivery company i have ever dealt with!!!!!!!! They say they made several attempts to deliver a package. I know they never came because there was no door notice left at any time. We even made sure someone was home.There staff are not very friendly. When we called them about the delivery, they weren’t helpful at all!,"
"A package was shipped 11/18 from North Carolina to be delivered to our home in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It arrived at a FedEx facility in Milwaukee on11/19. Instead of the package being delivered on 11/20, along with another package that we received that day via FedEx, the package was whisked off to Marquette, Michigan where it spent the weekend.  Supposedly it will make it’s way back to the Milwaukee FedEx facility and then on to our house tomorrow, 11/22. I won’t hold my breath."
"FedEx ""used"" to be my favorite shipping company. Dependable, on time, and good service(s). Always favored them over UPS/USPS.Flash forward to 2022......they are now the laughing stock of the parcel world. The past 6 retail packages from online purchases (who used FedEx to ship to me) all came 4-5 days late on every single instance. Each one always had some sort of ""delivery exception"", ""delayed"" notice and the delivery date constantly changing over and over.You would have a better and more reliable experience just tying a package to a sledding-dog and let him off into the wild."
"Trash company. I literally watched the Fedex truck roll past me from my open front door and a moment later I got an alert on my phone from FedEx stating I wasn't home to receive the delivery. I took off running (I only have one leg so it wasn't easy) to catch the truck before it rounded the cul-de-sac and got my package though not before the driver threatened to shoot me for ""getting in his face"""
Drivers DO NOT know how to drive my Fire Department has been on humorous calls for fed ex trucks ripping down wires and taking off also I've watched drivers literally throw my neighbors fragile package onto her porch when the package clearly says fragile handle with care they also speed through my neighborhood like it's a race track while there's no sidewalks on my road and almost got hit by a fed ex driver
"What absolute terrible service not only are my stuff delayed , they made me pay 2556,60 on over seas items that costed me less than 4k and they aren’t heavy correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t that more than 45% tax ?? Still have no received my items and I paid for express shipping , what’s the point of paying so much for express shipping if you don’t get your stuff on time ? And get it fast , absolute terrible service !"
"The worst company in the world. Package stuck for more than two weeks in local warehouse. Not processed, no information about status on the infoline. Not for the first time, but for sure for last!!! Only morons are working the, avoid!!!"
"I received a package on 11/18/22 and driver came upstairs on porch to avoid camera and package didn’t ring bell.A Caucasian male,on 11/19/22 a African American male delivered package rang doorbell and sat and waited to see if someone came to door.My question are Caucasian drivers trained the same?????"
"I am Sambhunath from G3fashion.com working as a customer support representative, I want to give zero star for the poor service i have received at fedex, after speaking with Savni and Suman and so many other employees working in customer care department in Fedex company, it has come to my knowledge that they don't care about the importance of their customer's concern and issue, they even told me that on phone call that they don't want to help. i have been wondering to know about one shipment which was shipped from Surat destination on 08/11/2022 and now it's 22-11-2022 but still there is no update and movement in the status of shipment (AWB -390290812370)"
Paid $39 for a package to go an hour away and it takes 5 f***en DAYS!!! Very poor service wll never use FedEx ever again!! Even Canada post would have had it there in 2 days!!! I sent it out November 16 wrote this review today and it’s still pending in the truck!!!
I think it is reasonable for a FedEx or any delivery service to knock on the door if there is no response from pushing the doorbell. Especially if you can’t hear a doorbell ring when pushed. I waited all day for a delivery. I went outside to check something and there was a notice on my door from FedEx. I have two Great Danes that bark at everything and didn’t hear this guy. Is the point to leave a notice or leave the package? Knock on the damn door.
"Terrible!!!! My package is either sent to wrong address and today not only was my package opened, torn and taped back up but my item was dirty. No matter how many times you call customer service to file a complaint, nothing is being done. I don’t know why business stop using fedex as the carrier. Worst service and experience."
"Awful, awful, awful courier. I am not even sure why this business is still operating. Either the employees are incompetent, or they are thieves. How idiotic can one be to mark an item(s) as delivered and provide photo proof for the wrong location? I know exactly where I live, I don't need to look outside around the door. I also take issue with the companies who utilize this courier. Are you not tired of dissatisfied customers?  I will gladly pay shipping cost screw free shipping... I want my items, or I want a refund pronto!"
On day 3 now of my package sitting in California 1:45 away from where it started. I'm at the point where if a seller uses fedex I'm just buying elsewhere. I have quite literally never had a package arrive on time with fedex. I have better and more consistent results with the post office. I have a package coming from China that is set to get here before fedex can deliver a package two staes over. My package was supposed to be here yesterday but now it's just pending a delivery date and sitting idle in California. Good job fedex....
I always know when a package is coming from fed ex it won’t be on time. I told one company I do business with that I won’t do fed ex!!! My Granddaughters 16th Bday present was to be delivered today and of course they didn’t make it .. Their Customer support is a joke
"I order from chewy who uses FedEx for years my boxes always come to front door not yesterday the delivery guy takes a picture of cones by our mail lockers 1st usps only puts mail pkgs in our lockers and key goes in our mail box.  This box from chewy is super heavy 35lb kitty litter, wet cat and dog food and puppy chucks their is no way that fits in a locker and where is my key.  Customer service is the worse"
"such a catastrophic company!I was waiting for an iPad, took this day free only to be home to receive the iPad. they didn't even ring at the door! and they said I was not home!how these people earn money??? how they get a salary???I think in jungle you can have better post service! I warned apple, if I will need to order again  one of their products and needs to be send it by Fedex, I will cancel the order immediately!!!"
